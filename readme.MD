# WebOS REST API

APIs are at the end of `main.py`. Add other APIs from [here](https://github.com/chros73/bscpylgtv/blob/master/bscpylgtv/webos_client.py) as needed.  
First time running will generate `.aiopylgtv.sqlite` 
after asking permission on TV itself to use bscpylgtv as remote control. 

Uses this for commands https://github.com/chros73/bscpylgtv
